WASHINGTON — Stellar pitching kept the Mets afloat in the first half of last season despite their offensive woes. But they cannot produce an encore of their pennant-winning season if their lineup keeps floundering while their pitching is nicked, bruised and stretched thin.
“We were going to ride our pitching,” Manager <name>Terry Collins</name> said before Wednesday’s game. “But we’re not riding it right now. We’ve got as many problems with our pitching as we do anything.”
Wednesday’s 4-2 loss to the Washington Nationals was cruel for the already-limping Mets. Pitching in <name>Steven Matz’s</name> place, the spot starter <name>Logan Verrett</name> allowed two runs over five innings. But even that was too large a deficit for the Mets’ lineup to overcome against <name>Max Scherzer</name>, the Nationals’ starter.
“We’re not even giving ourselves chances,” <name>Collins</name> said, adding later, “We just can’t give our pitchers any room to work.”
The Mets did not score until the ninth inning, when a last-gasp two-run homer by <name>James Loney</name> off Nationals reliever <name>Shawn Kelley</name> snapped a streak of 23 scoreless innings for the team.
The Mets were swept in the three-game series and fell six games behind the Nationals in the National League East. Of late, the Mets have looked worse than their 40-37 record.
“I don’t think we’ve played half our games yet this year,” right fielder <name>Curtis Granderson</name> said. “There’s still a lot of things left that can and hopefully will happen.”
<name>Scherzer</name> toyed with the Mets, who were initially without <name>Granderson</name> after he was scratched from the lineup with lingering calf tightness. Even though <name>Granderson</name> has been inconsistent this season, he had hit well against <name>Scherzer</name> in the past. <name>Alejandro De Aza</name>, who entered the game with a .165 average, started in right field instead because <name>Collins</name> said the team had few options.
After <name>Scherzer</name> gave up a single to <name>Asdrubal Cabrera</name> and walked <name>Loney</name> in the second inning, he retired the next 18 batters, until an eighth-inning single by <name>Brandon Nimmo</name>.
The Mets struggled again with runners on base. After <name>Nimmo</name> and the pinch-hitting <name>Granderson</name> singled in the eighth, pinch-hitter <name>Travis d’Arnaud</name> grounded out, and <name>De Aza</name> struck out.
“If they keep adding pressure on themselves, they’re going to continue to struggle,” <name>Collins</name> said. “That’s one of the things we try to make sure they have to understand: They have to be themselves.”
General Manager <name>Sandy Alderson</name>, <name>Collins</name> and the coaching staff have met about the offense and discussed the odd dynamics: Some players are performing at or better than their career averages, but the lineup as a whole has struggled immensely, especially with runners in scoring position.
“We’re just not driving in any runs,” <name>Collins</name> said. “That’s been the frustrating part. It’s not that we’re striking out. We’re popping up, or a double-play ball.”
The Mets have a power-hitting team, so asking players to bunt or hit and run would go against their strengths.
“When you start to change a team that’s built one way and start to make them do something different, you’re going to get your butt beat,” <name>Collins</name> said.
Earlier in the season, the Mets appeared like an all-or-nothing, home-run-driven team. Although they hit only .211 as a team in May, they smashed 40 home runs. They have a higher average in June, but they have hit only 24 homers, and the inconsistent offense has put a strain on the pitching staff.
In the second inning, <name>Verrett</name> gave up a solo home run to the ex-Met <name>Daniel Murphy</name>. <name>Collins</name> wanted to limit the workloads of <name>Addison Reed</name> and <name>Jeurys Familia</name>, so he turned to reliever <name>Sean Gilmartin</name> in the eighth. <name>Gilmartin</name> gave up a two-run homer to <name>Murphy</name>, who has hit .429 (15 for 35) with four home runs against the Mets this season, his first since leaving the team.
“I felt like I kept us in the game and gave us a chance to come back and win it,” <name>Verrett</name> said. “I wish that I wouldn’t have given up the two runs.”
<name>Verrett</name> was put in this position because of the effects of bone spurs on the Mets’ rotation. The team asked <name>Verrett</name> to start Wednesday and gave <name>Matz </name>an extra day of rest after he received anti-inflammatory medication for the large bone spur in his left elbow. He will try to pitch through it.
<name>Noah Syndergaard</name> has a smaller and less intrusive bone spur in the back of his right elbow.
“As long as I’m staying on my anti-inflammatories and my mechanics are on point, I’m able to go out there every five days and compete,” <name>Syndergaard</name> said.
For the Mets, the immediate road ahead will be even tougher. <name>Matz</name> was expected to pitch Thursday against the Chicago Cubs, one of the best teams in baseball this season.
