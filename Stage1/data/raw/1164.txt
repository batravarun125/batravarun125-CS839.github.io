Chameleons snack by shooting out their impressive tongues, zapping a meal as far as two body lengths away. But no one has figured out how those tongues latch onto the prey and snap it back into the animal’s mouth.
Researchers now have the explanation: Amucus secreted by the animal’s tongue pads makes for very sticky spit.
Scientists collected chameleon saliva and tested it for adhesiveness. The stuff is 400 times as viscous as human saliva, they found, and sticky enough to trap not only insects but even large prey — birds, lizards or small mammals — without the aid of suction or any other mechanism.
