OMAHA — The United States Olympic swimming trials are the spectacle that <name>Michael Phelps<\name> built. If he had not strapped the sport to his broad back and climbed to the Olympic summit six times in Athens in 2004 and eight times in eight nights in Beijing in 2008, there would be no pre-finals light show at CenturyLink Center, no ticket scalpers. The crowds would be far smaller than 14,000, and fewer athletes would be extending their careers past college with the help of corporate endorsements.
And there would have been at least one fewer entrant in the 200-meter butterfly.
<name>Phelps’s<\name> influence on the sport he set out to make more prominent, more professional, goes well beyond the eyeballs and the excitement he has brought to swimming since he appeared in his first United States trials, a much more subdued affair in Indianapolis in 2000. <name>Phelps<\name> has inspired a generation to swim, including a few world-caliber athletes who crafted competitive schedules in <name>Phelps’s</name> image.
Nobody was <name>Phelps’s</name> equal in the 200-meter butterfly final on Wednesday. He qualified for his fifth Olympic team by winning in 1 minute 54.84 seconds, ahead of <name>Tom Shields</name> (1:55.81). Those in his wake included <name>Chase Kalisz</name>, 22, who finished fifth, having already earned a berth to the Rio Games with a victory in the 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.
<name>Kalisz’s</name> best leg in the I.M. is the breaststroke, and he could probably be world-class in that stroke’s events if he put his mind (and his training) to it. But <name>Kalisz</name> grew up in the Baltimore suburbs, and his second home was Meadowbrook Aquatic & Fitness Center, which Phelps had made famous as the most illustrious in a long line of star swimmers produced by North Baltimore Aquatic Club.
<name>Kalisz</name> wanted to be like <name>Mike</name>, so he made himself into a world-class butterfly swimmer. “Me doing butterfly is a testament to me wanting to swim the same event as <name>Michael<\name>,” <name>Kalisz</name> said. “Butterfly didn’t come natural to me.”
He added: “Butterfly was something I had to work at, and I just loved racing next to <name>Michael</name>, and I did that enough that ultimately I would say the 200 butterfly is probably my second-best event. So I think me just wanting to emulate <name>Michael</name> so much is why my 2 fly is the way it is.”
The <name>Phelps</name> effect knows no geographical boundaries. At the 2012 Olympics, the South African <name>Chad Le Clos</name> swam the same four individual events as <name>Phelps</name> (the 100 and 200 butterfly and the 200 and 400 I.M.). After handing Phelps his first international defeat in 10 years in the 200 butterfly, <name>Le Clos</name> explained that he had added more events to his program, including the one that gave him a gold medal, after watching Phelps win a record eight golds in Beijing.
“He was the reason I swam the butterfly,” <name>Le Clos said</name>. “It’s not a joke.”
He added: “That’s why I swim the 200 freestyle, both the I.M.s. I don’t swim it for any other reason than just because Michael does.”
<name>Le Clos</name> took it personally when <name>Phelps</name> said last year that the men’s butterfly times around the world had been slow after the London Games, a factor that nudged <name>Phelps</name> out of retirement. After winning the 100 butterfly in 50.56 seconds at last summer’s world championships in Russia — a competition from which <name>Phelps</name> was absent — <name>Le Clos</name> crowed that his idol could “keep quiet now.”
<name>Phelps</name>, who competed at the United States senior nationals last summer after being removed from the American squad for the world championships following a drunken-driving arrest, responded hours later with a 50.45 to win the 100 butterfly.
