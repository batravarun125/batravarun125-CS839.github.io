SAN FRANCISCO — Saudi Arabia’s $3.5 billion bet on Uber is perhaps the biggest single investment in a start-up on record.
And guiding the Middle Eastern kingdom on its move were just two advisers: JPMorgan Chase on the financial side and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom on the legal side.
The $3.5 billion investment is enormous by any measure. Put into perspective, it is bigger than the amount Google raised in its initial public offering of stock in 2004.
While such a deal is not likely to yield a huge payday for the two companies, it lends them some bragging rights. And it could position them for plum advisory positions for Saudi Arabia down the line, including the forthcoming initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the country’s gargantuan state-owned oil company.
JPMorgan is already one of the banks helping advise the kingdom on that offering.
