As the television news business — the programs that report it and those that mock it — braces for the presidential conventions next month, one correspondent at “The Daily Show” has determined that this is as good a time as any to exit the series.
<name>Jessica Williams</name>, who has been an on-air personality at that Comedy Central news satire show since 2012, said on Wednesday that she would be departing the series after this week. When she was hired at “The Daily Show” during the tenure of then-host <name>Jon Stewart</name>, <name>Ms. Williams</name>, now 26, was its first black female correspondent. And when <name>Mr. Stewart</name> announced last year that he was stepping down from the show, some fans hoped that <name>Ms. Williams</name> would be in the running to replace him, though she herself nixed that suggestion, writing on Twitter that she was “extremely underqualified for the job.” (<name>Mr. Stewart</name> was succeeded by <name>Trevor Noah</name>.)
<name>Ms. Williams</name> said in an interview in Entertainment Weekly that she would focus on a scripted TV series she is working on for Comedy Central under a development deal there, adding, “I feel like I’m growing up and graduating.” She also continues to host “2 Dope Queens,” a comedy show and storytelling podcast, with <name>Phoebe Robinson</name>.
Comedy Central said in a post on its Twitter feed that it “couldn’t be more excited that <name>Jessica</name> remains in the Comedy Central family as we collaborate on her upcoming pilot.”
