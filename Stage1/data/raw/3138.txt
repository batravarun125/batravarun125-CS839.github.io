Some of the most memorable moments of a family vacation are also the most awkward. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, because what great photos they make! We’re asking you to dig through your archives, and your smart phones, to find and share with us your uncomfortable vacation photos. Why keep these hilarious memories to yourself?
Post yours to Instagram using the hashtag #awkwardfamilytravels and we may use them as part of a future project.
