LITTLE FALLS, N.J. — In a private interview after a news conference in which only baseball-related questions were requested, <name>Higinio Vélez</name> was asked one that veered well outside the preapproved lines.
He did not scowl or storm off. He smiled and said, “That was a great question for the public, the one I was waiting for.”
Then <name>Vélez</name>, the president of the Cuban Baseball Federation and a former manager of Cuba’s national team, gave an answer that was as paradoxical as it was political.
The federation, he said, welcomes the thawing of Cuba’s relationship with the United States, hopes for more visits like the national team’s swing through the independent Can-Am League this month, and does not fear his country’s fertile developmental system will be infiltrated by Major League Baseball.
The Cuban players, he said through an interpreter, “are living their dream — they are in Cuba because they want to be there.” He added, “We don’t worry about them wanting to come here.”
He said that, even as the country’s best players continue to land in the United States, shedding government and federation constraints however they can.
At that moment, “here” was the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, on the campus of Montclair State University, where a Monday news conference preceded a three-game series between the Cuban team and the New Jersey Jackals at the adjacent stadium, also named for Berra. In the opener, on Tuesday night, the Cubans won a rain-shortened seven-inning contest, 9-4, before a sparse crowd.
The Jackals series is the conclusion of a 19-game swing in which the Cubans have faced the six Can-Am League teams — three in Canada, where the tour was conceived, and three in northern New Jersey and Rockland County, N.Y.
Along the way, despite many Cuban pronouncements regarding the warmth and hospitality they have encountered, there has been evidence of old-world stubbornness, of the status quo, with a touch of tortured sportsmanship.
On Wednesday night, back at Berra Stadium, an international incident was avoided after the Cuban manager, <name>Roger Machado</name>, pulled his team off the field in protest of a grand slam hit down the left-field line by the Jackals’ <name>Adam Martin</name>. Although the ball appeared to be foul, the umpires reversed the call without the benefit of a replay.
The Jackals won anyway, 3-1, with the Cubans left furious by a close call at first base on the last out. The good-will tour will end, perhaps mercifully, on Thursday night.
While the Cubans — who said they had brought about half their front-line national team players — were losing seven of 10 games in Canada before reeling off seven straight victories south of the border, the star infielder <name>Yulieski Gourriel</name>, 32, was auditioning for major league clubs, having defected in February.
And during a shopping trip last week after a series in New Jersey against the Sussex County Miners, <name>Lázaro Ramirez</name>, a 24-year-old outfielder, slipped away from the Cuban team. He had not returned.
The apparent defection led to a tense weekend in Rockland County, where the Cuban players snubbed Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban pitcher with the high leg kick whose harrowing 1997 exit by boat led to a flamboyantly productive run with the Yankees.
“No one say hi to me; no one shake my hand,” a deflated <name>Hernandez</name> told reporters after throwing out the first pitch to the former Yankees catcher <name>John Flaherty</name>, who is now a limited partner of the Rockland Boulders.
The team had invited <name>Hernandez</name>, to kick off the weekend series on Friday night, with 75-year-old <name>Luis Tiant</name>, a Cuban legend and </name>Hernandez’s<name> stylistic ancestor, tapped for the Sunday series closer.
<name>Shawn Reilly</name>, the Boulders’ executive vice president and general manager, said Cuban officials had expressed their displeasure over <name>Hernandez’s</name> presence, especially because the game was being televised by ESPN Deportes.
“They sat down in my office and were adamant that first pitch was not to be broadcast back to Cuba,” Reilly said. He added that while the weekend was a box office success and “we’d love to play them again,” it was “a headache, high maintenance.”
The Boulders, <name>Reilly</name> said, had to pick up the costs for heightened security after <name>Ramirez’s</name> disappearance. The Cubans’ per diem demands were much higher than Can-Am League norms. And in contrast to the relaxed conventions of independent baseball, the Cuban players were marched from one place to the next by delegation officials, with little time for mixing with fans, many of whom, <name>Reilly said</name>, were Cubans.
When the Cuban team arrived in New Jersey on Monday, a trip to Union City, long identified with Cuban-Americans, was canceled because of security concerns. The Cuban team also rejected a planned boat tour around Manhattan before later agreeing to go.
<name>Michel Laplante</name>, the president of the Can-Am League’s Quebec Capitales, who provided the inspiration for the Cuban tour, said it was wrong to interpret the national team’s behavior as standoffish. Across the political and cultural divide, from his Canadian perspective, it seemed more complicated than that.
“When you sit down with them and they explain their position, sometimes you’ll say, oh, that makes sense,” <name>Laplante</name> said.
For instance, there was a brief uproar in Cuba when the team lost three of four games in Quebec City. There was little tolerance back home for news of tourist events by the Cuban team when competitive national pride was at stake.
<name>Laplante</name>, who spent most of a nine-year minor league career in the Pittsburgh Pirates’ organization, forged a relationship with the Cuban federation several years ago, shepherding a group of Canadian boys to the island to learn the game in a less-pampered environment. He approached the Cubans with a more radical idea in 2014, telling them, “I am the president of a team in Quebec City — why not send someone to play for us?”
Soon after, <name>Yuniesky Gourriel</name>, the older and less talented brother of the most recent star defector, became the first Cuban ballplayer in more than half a century to play professionally in North America with the Cuban government’s permission.
Three more Cubans arrived in Quebec City last season. <name>Heriberto Suárez</name>, Cuba’s baseball commissioner, told The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, “We have set a precedent with the contracts we have done.”
