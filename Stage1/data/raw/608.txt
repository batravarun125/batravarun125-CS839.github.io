On Saturday afternoon, the legendary fashion photographer Bill Cunningham died in Manhattan at age 87. Shielded from the elements by a simple blue coat and with a camera always in his hand, Mr. Cunningham was a fixture on the streets of New York City and in the front rows of fashion’s most prestigious shows. Many took to Twitter to mourn the loss of Mr. Cunningham and to honor the man for whom everybody dressed — even Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue.
