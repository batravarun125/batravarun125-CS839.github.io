Color hints at the flavor of honey. Wildflower is pale and delicate; chestnut, dark and robust. But thereâ€™s more to it. At a tasting led by Carla Marina Marchese, a beekeeper who founded the American Honey Tasting Society, participants will learn the particulars of six single-origin honeys, how the bees make each and the characteristics of terroir. Cheese pairings are included: $40, May 26, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., Mofad Lab, Museum of Food and Drink, 62 Bayard Street (Lorimer Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, mofad.org. Participants must be 21 or older.
