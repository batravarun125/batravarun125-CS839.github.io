PARIS — Crowds form wherever <name>Olivier Rousteing<name> of Balmain decides to hold his show. The solid odds that one of his famous friends — ideally a Kardashian, <name>Jenner</name> or <name>West</name> — might attend are a powerful lure.
There were no Kardashians in the audience for his men’s wear show at the Hôtel Potocki in Paris on Saturday afternoon, but several others were there: The basketball player <name>Nick Young</name>, the N.F.L. wide receivers <name>Victor Cruz</name> and <name>Brice Butler</name>, and the pop singer <name>Ricky Martin</name> all came to see what <name>Mr. Rousteing</name> had planned. It turned out to be a typically brazen collection of denim and mesh, stone-encrusted and mirror-stitched beachwear for the international playboy, not unlike themselves, whose exploits in turn inspired the collection. (<name>Mr. Rousteing</name> said that while he may not be able to escape the design studio to hit the beach, he could at least scroll through the Instagram feeds of those who could.)
After the show, <name>Mr. Martin</name>, whose European tour resumes in September, called Balmain’s maximalist grandeur “the future.” (He is the father of twin 7-year-olds, so he has a vested interest in the bedazzled sportswear of tomorrow.) On his way out the door, he shared a few thoughts on the collection.
What did you think of the show?
It’s just so exciting. I love the way he just keeps pushing things forward.
