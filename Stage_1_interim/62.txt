On a fund-raising swing to the West Coast last weekend, <name>Bill Clinton</name> had a casual dinner with <name>Mark Cuban</name>, the outspoken businessman and TV star who has inserted himself into the 2016 campaign, criticizing <name>Donald J. Trump</name> and even offering himself as a potential vice-presidential candidate for <name>Hillary Clinton</name>.
The dinner took place at the Los Angeles home of <name>Michael Kives</name>, a Hollywood agent and a top bundler for <name>Mrs. Clinton</name>, and comes amid one of the more unusual political courtships unfolding in the 2016 campaign.
<name>Mr. Cuban</name>, the often-fined owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team for his outlandish comments and berating of N.B.A. officials, and a star of ABC’s “Shark Tank,” had previously said he planned to sit down with <name>Mrs. Clinton</name>.
In the meantime, he enjoyed an extended conversation about politics, business and philanthropy with the former president, said three people with firsthand knowledge of the gathering who could not discuss a private event for attribution.
An aide said <name>Mr. Clinton</name> regularly tacks on social events with friends while traveling the country to help his wife’s campaign. The small but eclectic dinner party in Los Angeles also included the musician <name>Stevie Wonder</name>: the actors <name>Bryan Cranston</name> and <name>Ted Danson</name>; <name>John Dauer</name>, the vocalist in the band The Ruse and a friend of <name>Chelsea Clinton</name>; and <name>Gene Sperling</name>, an economic adviser to both <name>Mr. Clinton</name> and President <name>Obama</name>.
<name>Mr. Clinton</name> has known <name>Mr. Cuban</name> for several years. The billionaire has attended Clinton Global Initiative conferences, watched basketball with the 42nd president, and spoke at a Clinton Foundation-related event in Dallas last year that also featured former President <name>George W. Bush</name>.
While the dinner was not a fund-raiser, it did further immerse <name>Mr. Cuban</name>, whose incendiary statements and pro-business positions could turn off some Democrats, in the inner circle of <name>Mrs. Clinton’s</name> West Coast supporters, should he decide to give to the Clinton campaign or “super PAC” supporting such efforts.
<name>Mr. Cuban</name> did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. A spokesman for <name>Mr. Clinton</name> declined to comment.
Last month, <name>Mr. Cuban</name> told NBC’s “Meet the Press” he would “absolutely” entertain the idea of being <name>Mrs. Clinton’s</name> running mate, but that “she would have to go more to the center.”
Asked about <name>Mr. Cuban’s</name> comments, <name>Mrs. Clinton</name> said, “I appreciate his openness to it,” adding: “I think we should look widely and broadly. It’s not just people in elective office. It is successful business people.”
He did credit <name>Mr. Trump</name> for opening up a pathway for nontraditional candidates. “You don’t have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would’ve been in the past,” <name>Mr. Cuban</name> said.
As <name>Mrs. Clinton</name> seeks to appeal to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and voters who supported <name>Bernie Sanders</name>, her campaign is simultaneously, and delicately, seeking the endorsements of Republican and Republican-leaning business leaders. <name>Mr. Cuban</name> has said he would like to vote Republican on fiscal issues and a smaller government, but disagrees with the party on most social issues.
Last week, just before <name>Mrs. Clinton</name> delivered a populist economic pitch alongside <name>Elizabeth Warren</name>, her campaign released a list of business leaders, including several Republicans, who had endorsed her, including <name>Daniel F. Akerson</name>, the former chairman and chief executive of General Motors, and <name>Richard Anderson</name>, the Delta Air Lines executive.
On Friday, <name>Henry M. Paulson Jr.</name>, the treasury secretary under <name>Mr. Bush</name> during the 2008 financial crisis and a former Goldman Sachs chief executive, expressed his support for <name>Mrs. Clinton</name>. In The Washington Post, <name>Mr. Paulson</name> wrote that a presidency would be “unthinkable.”
