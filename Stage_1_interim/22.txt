WASHINGTON — A self-described conservative North Carolina businessman has promised to spend at least $5 million through his political action committee to back five Republican congressional candidates who have supported taking action to curb climate change.
Even as his party’s presumptive presidential nominee denies the existence of global warming, the businessman, <name>Jay Faison</name>, and his ClearPath Action Fund will spend at least $2 million on digital media campaigns to defend Senate incumbents running in two of the tightest races in the country, <name>Rob Portman</name> in Ohio and <name>Kelly Ayotte</name> in New Hampshire, a recognition of the senators’ support for clean energy, <name>Mr. Faison</name> said Wednesday. The advertisements are expected to start running this week.
ClearPath is also spending several hundred thousand dollars on digital advertising campaigns to support Representatives <name>Carlos Curbelo</name> of Florida and <name>Tom Reed</name> and <name>Elise Stefanik</name> of New York, all Republicans running for re-election in similarly tight races.
“What we’re trying to do is prove to the party, through these races, that clean energy wins races, to build a political safe space for the Republican Party to talk about this,” <name>Mr. Faison</name> said in an interview. “It is difficult for a politician to consistently act in an area with no reward. We have their back.” He added, “We’re also making that case to the Trump campaign.”
The spending comes as Republican leaders have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change and attacked President <name>Obama’s</name> climate change policies. <name>Donald J. Trump</name>, the presumptive nominee, has mocked climate science and vowed to cancel the Paris Agreement, the 2015 global accord committing nearly every country on earth to taking action to fight climate change.
Senator <name>Mitch McConnell</name>, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, calls <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> climate policies a “war on coal.” But some Republican members of Congress who hope to carve out careers that could outlast <name>Mr. Trump’s</name> have begun to quietly consider how to address climate change, which they believe resonates with a growing segment of voters, particularly young people.
Political strategists are paying attention to polls that show Americans expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening. A March Gallup poll found that 64 percent of American adults worry “a great deal” or “a fair amount” about global warming, the highest number since 2008, and it found that a record 65 percent of Americans attribute global warming to human activity.
However, most polls asking voters to rank the importance of issues find that environmental concerns trail far behind concerns about jobs and the economy.
Still, in many campaigns, Democrats are attacking Republicans as climate deniers.
Some moderate Republicans hope to use their views on climate change to draw a contrast with <name>Mr. Trump</name>.
“All of them need to demonstrate a level of independence from the national party in order to survive,” said <name>Nathan Gonzales</name>, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, speaking of the five lawmakers backed by <name>Mr. Faison’s</name> group. “They’ll need to declare independence from <name>Donald Trump</name>.”
In 2015, <name>Ms. Ayotte</name> broke with her party to vote against a measure written by <name>Mr. McConnell</name> that would have blocked <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> climate change rules. She also voted for a program to establish grants to schools for climate change education, against a proposal to block the Obama administration from signing on to the Paris climate change accord, and in favor of a federal fund to respond to the threat of climate change.
<name>Mr. Portman</name> voted with his party on most of those measures, but also voted in favor of the fund to respond to climate threats. He has worked for years with Senator <name>Jeanne Shaheen</name>, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a bill to improve energy efficiency in buildings. He is a former board member of the Nature Conservancy and is a co-author of legislation to support cleanup of the Great Lakes.
The three House members backed by <name>Mr. Faison’s</name> group are among just 13 Republicans who have signed on to a resolution, offered by Representative <name>Chris Gibson</name>, Republican of New York. “The resolution was a vehicle to find out which Republicans were willing to step up and take some action,” said <name>Steve Valk</name>, a spokesman for Citizen’s Climate Lobby.
But while those five Republicans’ environmental records stand out from many in their party, they have voted more times against environmental regulations than in favor. The League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers’ environmental records on a scale of 1 to 100, have given lifetime scores to <name>Ms. Ayotte</name> of 35 percent, <name>Mr. Portman</name> of 20 percent, <name>Mr. Curbelo</name> of 23 percent, <name>Mr. Reed</name> of 6 percent and <name>Ms. Stefanik</name> of 9 percent. “To give House Republicans like <name>Elise Stefanik</name>, <name>Tom Reed</name> or <name>Carlos Curbelo</name> credit for acknowledging that climate change is real is a very low bar,” said <name>Meredith Kelly</name>, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
In Miami, <name>Mr. Curbelo’s</name> opponent, <name>Annette Tadeo</name>, a Democrat, has slammed his climate positions as hypocritical. “Big oil and gas lobbyists have been filling his campaign coffers with thousands of dollars in cash, in exchange for his advocacy for offshore drilling,” she said in a statement.
In Ohio, <name>Mr. Portman</name> is fighting to keep his seat against a former governor, <name>Ted Strickland</name>, who notes his support of <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> climate plan and slams <name>Mr. Portman</name> for voting against it.
