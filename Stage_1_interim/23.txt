Their names read like a who’s who of the past half-century’s downtown performance scene. Among them: the playwright <name>Sam Shepard</name>, the composer <name>Meredith Monk</name> and the transgender actress and Warhol superstar <name>Candy Darling</name>. Early works by these artists and dozens more are coming to light Monday when La MaMa, the East Village performance space synonymous with the downtown avant-garde, releases an expanded version of its digital collections website.
Expect to see photographs of <name>Harvey Fierstein</name> in the early stages of creating his “Torch Song Trilogy”; a program from an overlooked Philip Glass opera; and ephemera from Warhol’s Factory. The website, catalog.lamama.org, will be in its most complete form yet as part of La MaMa’s 55th anniversary season.
Newly digitized offerings from the collection also include posters and videos, many from the earliest years of La MaMa, which was founded in 1961 by <name>Ellen Stewart</name>. (The website has hundreds of documents related to her.)
Also in the archives are photos of a young <name>Bette Midler</name> in her New York stage debut, acting in <name>Tom Eyen’s</name> Off Off Broadway musical comedy “<name>Miss Nefertiti</name> Regrets” in 1965 — a year before she made her Broadway debut in “Fiddler on the Roof.”
