OTTAWA — For President <name>Obama</name>, foreign trips these days have increasingly become an exercise in explaining the inflamed politics of his country to nervous foreigners.
So it was here on Wednesday, when <name>Mr. Obama</name> joined the leaders of Canada and Mexico at a summit meeting that began as a show of North American solidarity and ended up as an attempt to repudiate the nativist and isolationist currents that are agitating politics in the United States, as well as in Europe.
With the gothic spires of Canada’s Parliament as a backdrop, <name>Mr. Obama</name>, Prime Minister <name>Justin Trudeau</name> of Canada and President <name>Enrique Peña Nieto</name> of Mexico announced a landmark agreement on climate change and extolled the benefits of a Pacific Rim trade agreement. But it was the charged words in the American election and Britain’s departure from the European Union that seized most of the attention.
<name>Mr. Obama</name> deplored the anti-immigrant remarks of <name>Donald J. Trump</name>, the presumptive Republican nominee, particularly his statements about Mexican immigrants. Though he never mentioned <name>Mr. Trump</name> by name, <name>Mr. Obama</name> said the next American president would have a strong interest in having a solid relationship with “our good neighbor to the south.”
Speaking at a news conference with the Canadian and Mexican leaders after their meeting, the president said that anti-immigrant appeals had a long history in the United States, but that they had never permanently curtailed the flow of people into the country.
“We should take some of this rhetoric seriously and answer it boldly and clearly,” <name>Mr. Obama</name> said, answering a question from a Mexican journalist, “but you shouldn’t think it is representative of how the American people think.”
<name>Mr. Obama</name> said he rejected the argument that the harsh tone in the American presidential campaign, or in Britain’s recent referendum on leaving the European Union, was populist. He ridiculed the notion that a candidate who worked to preserve the interests of wealthy people could be a populist.
“They don’t suddenly become populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes,” <name>Mr. Obama</name> said. “That’s not the measure of populism; that’s nativism or xenophobia or worse. Or it’s just cynicism.”
<name>Mr. Peña Nieto</name>, for his part, put <name>Mr. Trump</name> in a line of populist demagogues, including <name>Hitler</name> and <name>Mussolini</name>, though he, like <name>Mr. Obama</name>, did not use the candidate’s name. “Those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today’s world,” he said.
Their comments lent urgency to the North American leaders’ summit meeting, a diplomatic ritual that usually goes unnoticed by the public. This meeting, in fact, slipped from being an annual gathering during the administration of <name>George W. Bush</name> to once-every-few-years during <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> presidency.
For <name>Mr. Trudeau</name>, who has inherited <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> mantle as a change agent, the meeting was a sort of debut on the global stage. He presented the deal under which Canada, the United States and Mexico pledged to generate half their power through clean energy sources by 2025. To achieve that goal, they will seek to harmonize energy regulations, increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.
Under <name>Mr. Trudeau’s</name> conservative predecessor, <name>Stephen Harper</name>, Canada pulled out of its commitments to the first global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and clashed with the United States over <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But <name>Mr. Trudeau</name> has recommitted Canada to legislative efforts to combat climate change, much as <name>Mr. Obama</name> did when he succeeded <name>Mr. Bush</name> in 2009.
For <name>Mr. Obama</name>, the visit was a chance to galvanize three major economies behind the advances made in the Paris climate-change accord, at a time when Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has clouded the prospects for multilateral cooperation and the durability of international agreements.
<name>Mr. Obama</name> said he worried that Britain’s exit from the European Union would freeze investment in the country and in Europe. The leaders also discussed the impact of Britain’s vote on trade agreements. Mexico and Canada are signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the mammoth Asia-Pacific deal that has stalled in the United States, with Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and <name>Mr. Trump</name> both coming out against it.
Appearing with <name>Mr. Peña Nieto</name> on Tuesday, a day before <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> arrival, <name>Mr. Trudeau</name> said, “We’ve seen around the world many examples of protectionism, of stepping away from trade agreements and engagements like we’re showcasing today.”
In a speech to the Canadian Parliament later in the day, <name>Mr. Obama</name> acknowledged that globalization had unleashed deeply disruptive forces.
“While the circumstances of Brexit may be unique to the United Kingdom,” he said, “the frustrations that people feel are not.” But an interconnected world, he argued, was irreversible. The remedy was to pursue policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would level the playing field.
<name>Mr. Obama’s</name> relations with <name>Mr. Harper</name> were tense, and the president had not visited Canada since 2010. With <name>Mr. Trudeau’s</name> election, however, the chill has given way to an affectionate big-brother relationship. In March, <name>Mr. Obama</name> celebrated <name>Mr. Trudeau</name> during a state visit to Washington that felt at times like a passing of the torch.
“He campaigned on a message of hope and of change; his positive and optimistic vision is inspiring young people,” <name>Mr. Obama</name> said. “On the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what’s not to like?”
This summit meeting is being marketed as a meeting of “three amigos.” But <name>Mr. Obama</name> is spending less time in Ottawa than <name>Mr. Trudeau</name> did in Washington. After his speech to the Parliament, at which he received a rapturous reception, <name>Mr. Obama</name> flew home, not spending a single night in the Canadian capital.
