A comedic drama about a young gay man yearning for love is the first new American play planned for the current Broadway season.
The producer <name>Jeffrey Richards</name> said he would bring the play, “Significant Other” by <name>Joshua Harmon</name>, to Broadway next winter, at a Shubert theater to be announced. He said the production, scheduled to begin performances in February and to open in March, would be directed by <name>Trip Cullman</name>, making his Broadway debut, and that “it is the intention of the producers to assemble the original cast,” which included <name>Gideon Glick</name>, <name>Barbara Barrie</name> and <name>Lindsay Mendez</name>.
The play had its premiere Off Broadway, under <name>Mr. Cullman’s</name> direction, at the Roundabout Theater Company in spring 2015, when The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood called it “entirely delightful.”
<name>Mr. Harmon</name>, 33, is also the author of “Bad Jews,” which, after premiering at Roundabout Underground and then transferring to Roundabout’s larger Off Broadway stage, rapidly became one of the most-produced plays in the country. And Roundabout has been workshopping a third play it has commissioned from <name>Mr. Harmon</name>.
“Significant Other” would be the second Broadway play in a year written by an artist championed by Roundabout Underground, the nonprofit’s program for emerging artists. “The Humans,” which won the Tony Award for best new play this year, had a previous run at Roundabout, and that play’s author, <name>Stephen Karam</name>, first attracted notice with “Speech & Debate” at Roundabout Underground.
