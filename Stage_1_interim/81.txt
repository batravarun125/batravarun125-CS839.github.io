President <name>Obama</name> will appear next week with <name>Hillary Clinton</name>, the 2016 campaigning debut for the figure expected to be <name>Mrs. Clinton’s</name> most potent surrogate in the fall.
The two are scheduled to be in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday for what the Clinton campaign described as a discussion of “building on the progress we’ve made.”
<name>Mr. Obama</name> had been scheduled to campaign with the presumptive Democratic nominee in Wisconsin two weeks ago, but the event was canceled after the nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla.
In a video this month endorsing <name>Mrs. Clinton</name>, his former Democratic presidential rival and secretary of state, <name>Mr. Obama</name> said he did not think a candidate had ever been so qualified for the office.
“I know how hard this job can be,” he said. “That’s why I know <name>Hillary</name> will be so good at it.”
The location of the rally is notable. <name>Clinton</name> aides view North Carolina as a potential opportunity to expand on <name>Mr. Obama’s</name> 2012 electoral map. He lost the state four years ago, after winning it in 2008.
