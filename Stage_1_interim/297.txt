Up the block came three young men, shoelaces lapping at the sidewalk, faces half-hidden in hoods, to pay their respects to a fallen street soldier.
They stopped at a mural splashed with rubber-banded rolls of $100 bills, next to calligraphy spelling out “Heart of the Hood” and “Money come & go but Legends Live Forever.” The face of <name>Francisco Perez</name>, six feet high and sun-dappled, stared out coolly over his old haunts. A red die showing five sat on a discarded bureau nearby.
“Cisco, 12-26-78 — 4-4-16,” the mural read, referring to <name>Mr. Perez’s</name> street name.
Over nearly three decades, <name>Mr. Perez</name> held court on this block of East 157th Street off Melrose Avenue in the South Bronx. It was here that he climbed the rungs of the street heroin trade, wooed women, muscled out drug rivals from nearby public housing projects and, as he got closer to middle age, counseled young men to save themselves and to get honest work.
By turns brutal and vain, comedic and exacting, <name>Mr. Perez</name> survived police raids, stickups, territorial incursions and a transformation of the city’s drug trade as it came to rely less than it once had on hand-to-hand street sales.
All the while, his crew and a former dealer shot at each other and tallied the hits. The bad blood led to the 2005 murder of a female bystander and, <name>Mr. Perez’s</name> friends said, spawned a round of tit-for-tat shootings in the months before his death. As he turned the corner toward home on a cold March morning, an assailant hiding behind a row of cars popped out and pounded him with .40-caliber bullets. It was the fifth of nine murders recorded this year in the 40th Precinct, the second-deadliest precinct in New York City after the 75th in East New York. The homicide figure already equals the total for all of last year.
Drug violence has plummeted since the early 1990s, when the neighborhoods of Mott Haven and Melrose and the rest of the precinct could see nine killings in a month. But some men still battle, though less conspicuously, over customers, turf and debts on the same corners, little touched by tides of economic change and opportunity.
By the time of his death, at 37, <name>Mr. Perez</name> was a balding father running with men half his age, a throwback whose taste for Biggie Smalls, Air Jordans and knife fights harked back to the ’90s. He promised to start coming home earlier and get a real job, but his past always stayed with him.
“He had beef in a lot of places,” said <name>Nicolas Mendez</name>, 23, a close friend. And <name>Mr. Perez</name> sometimes fanned the flames. “He’s crazy a little bit,” <name>Mr. Mendez</name> added. “He’s a little bugged out.”
The recent visit by his younger friends to the mural was brief. The most deliberate of the three, a coiled spring of a man with dark eyes and an angular face, bent over and lit a $2.50 votive candle dedicated to Our Lady of Altagracia.
Then he announced, “We out,” and they swiveled and strode down 157th Street to their corner.
The mural celebrated the outer layer of <name>Mr. Perez</name>. This was the man of fur-trimmed coats and new Nikes, bottles of Hennessy and talk of accepting a long prison sentence to spare his friends from the same. A cousin, <name>Maddie</name>, said that persona hid a deep well of pain and an insatiable longing for family.
“He had this mask on when he was in the street,” she said, “so he would look like this guy.”
Born to a mother addicted to heroin and a father whose name and whereabouts were always a mystery, <name>Mr. Perez</name> used to wake up on weekends at 6 a.m. to go door to door in the projects selling The Daily News.
“Papers, Sunday newspapers!” he shouted in the hallways as he and Maddie, both about 9, banged on doors.
They made 50 cents per sale. <name>Mr. Perez</name> supplemented that with a job bagging groceries at a C-Town supermarket, collecting tips in a small bowl.
Once, half-jokingly, he loaded his and <name>Maddie’s</name> socks into the dishwasher because her mother had no washing machine; he added dish detergent, ran the machine and split them between an oven and a microwave to dry.
A crack epidemic and poverty were ravaging the South Bronx in the 1980s, and debris became children’s playthings. They roamed a junkyard where people went for secondhand parts, sitting in stripped-down cars and mimicking an engine’s roar.
Crack vials covered the project’s sidewalks “like pigeon poop,” said <name>Maddie</name>, sitting on her stoop in a city hundreds of miles from the Bronx where she had moved in her 20s. Out of fear for her safety, she asked that neither her city nor her surname be identified. She and <name>Mr. Perez</name> used to shout, “Don’t step on the crack, you break your mother’s back!”
In <name>Mr. Perez’s</name> vast family, women were the anchors; the only male mentors he had were steeped in the aggressive ways of the street, <name>Maddie</name> said.
“You don’t know what a man is, because the only man that society showed you was the one on the corner,” she said. “Pretty much that’s what the Bronx shows you: the man on the corner.”
By the early ’90s, the corner of East 157th Street and Melrose Avenue was beckoning local children looking for easy cash, along with middle-class workers, like teachers and mail carriers, who were falling under heroin’s sway.
The intersection was among the Bronx’s busier drug markets, just far enough from the hubbub of the projects and the police stationed there, and a quick hop from several thoroughfares. Arson and demolitions had left a single five-story building on the south side of 157th Street, with a few squatters inside. Heroin changed hands in the lobby and on a second-floor landing.
“We used to call it the Well — you could sit a block off it and just pick off guys who were buying,” said <name>Charles McLiverty</name>, a retired New York police detective who worked in Bronx Narcotics from 1993 to 1997. “People would drive up in cars — New Jersey, Connecticut, upstate New York — and they knew this was the place to go.”
<name>Mr. Perez</name> was in his early teens at the time, watching his mother sink into heroin addiction. The drug was making a comeback across the city as it became cheaper and purer, the first wave in a resurgence of heroin that is now swallowing many middle-class communities.
“She would use heroin as a way to cope with physical and emotional pain, and <name>Mr. Perez</name> learned those habits from her,” a federal defender, <name>Annalisa Mirón</name>, wrote in court papers in 2014 after <name>Mr. Perez</name> was accused of selling the drug.
When he was 13, his mother died from complications of H.I.V. His grandmother took him in, but then she died, too. He lived with an aunt until she moved away. A second aunt, <name>Maddie’s</name> mother, took over raising him; about a year later she also died from complications of H.I.V.
“That’s how it started: death,” <name>Maddie</name> said of her cousin’s street life. “You feel like, ‘Everyone I love is dead.’”
Maddie and <name>Mr. Perez</name>, both around 17, took her mother’s life-insurance check and moved into a one-bedroom public housing apartment in the northern Bronx.
To cover the $550 rent, Maddie took a job folding clothes at a <name>Dr. Jay’s</name> store; <name>Mr. Perez</name> studied for a high school equivalency diploma. He chopped onions and peppers for spaghetti, the only dinner they knew how to make, and pleaded in vain for Maddie to iron his pants before dates.
Home life was weighted with loss and obligation. The corner at 157th and Melrose pulled him back. He told Maddie that the money he earned there would pay for studio time to record rap music, and that he would leave the streets once he became successful.
“I don’t want a girl with extensions in her hair / bamboo sneakers, at least nine pairs,” <name>Maddie</name> said, recalling an early rap, an admiring take, it would appear, on “Around the Way Girl,” the 1990 track by LL Cool J. “A C-Town bag and a bad attitude / That’s all I need to mess up my good mood!”
