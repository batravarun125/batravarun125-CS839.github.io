<name>Stephen Curry</name> isn’t on the team, and neither is <name>LeBron James</name> or <name>Russell Westbrook</name>. Nor is <name>Kawhi Leonard</name>, <name>Chris Paul</name> or <name>James Harden</name>.
Though all those players would be automatic selections to a “best American” basketball team, each has bowed out of consideration for the United States Olympic team, citing fatigue or injury.
But the 12 men who were named to the team Monday morning are still a formidable group and will be heavily favored to win another gold medal. In other words, the United States bench is deep.
The best American gymnasts or volleyball players would not pass up an Olympic opportunity. And most international men’s basketball stars keep playing for their home countries as long as they can. <name>Dirk Nowitzki</name> was still plugging away last summer at age 37 for Germany at the European championship.
But with a grueling N.B.A. schedule just completed and another one around the corner, many of America’s best have decided this is not the year to add a summer tournament to their schedules.
Does this open up an opportunity for Nigeria or Venezuela to win the gold in Rio? Well, no.
The United States team starts with one no-arguments superstar, <name>Kevin Durant</name> of the Oklahoma City Thunder. No other country will feature a player who nears his all-around skills.
<name>Curry</name> is missing, but the other Splash Brother, <name>Klay Thompson</name>, is on the team, along with his Warriors teammates <name>Draymond Green</name> and <name>Harrison Barnes</name>. Though <name>James</name> is taking the summer off, the N.B.A. champion Cleveland Cavaliers are represented by <name>Kyrie Irving</name>.
The American team is notably versatile. Except for the two centers, <name>DeMarcus Cousins</name> and <name>DeAndre Jordan</name>, and the two point guards, <name>Irving</name> and <name>Kyle Lowry</name>, every player is listed from 6 feet 7 to 6-9, and many play multiple positions.
<name>Paul George</name> is also on the team, despite having sustained a serious leg injury while training for the 2014 World Cup of Basketball, which caused him to miss nearly a full N.B.A. season.
The team is rounded out by <name>Jimmy Butler</name>, <name>DeMar DeRozan</name> and <name>Carmelo Anthony</name>, playing in his fourth Olympics. In recent days, <name>Anthony</name> has been socializing with <name>Durant</name> in New York and working out with him in what amounts to an unofficial wooing of the Oklahoma City star before he officially becomes a free agent next month.
Would <name>Durant</name> really consider joining <name>Anthony</name> on the work-in-progress Knicks, who traded for <name>Derrick Rose</name> last week? Probably not, but <name>Anthony</name> can keep trying right through the Olympics, where the Americans’ status as gold-medal favorites is enhanced by the other contenders’ relatively weak rosters.
Spain has been the second-best team in the world for many years, but it is led by a 35-year-old, <name>Pau Gasol</name>. The status of his brother <name>Marc</name>, who broke his foot with the Grizzlies in February, is unclear, and <name>Serge Ibaka</name>, the Orlando Magic star, will not play, citing the long N.B.A. season. That leaves <name>Ricky Rubio</name> as Spain’s No. 2 star.
Other contenders have even fewer N.B.A.-quality players. Lithuania, runner-up to Spain in last year’s Euros, is led by <name>Jonas Valanciunas</name>, a solid center for the Raptors who would not have come close to the Olympics were he an American.
