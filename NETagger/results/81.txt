The two are scheduled to be in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday for what the <name>Clinton</name> campaign described as a discussion of “building on the progress we’ve made.” Mr. <name>Obama</name> had been scheduled to campaign with the presumptive Democratic nominee in Wisconsin two weeks ago, but the event was canceled after the nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla. In a video this month endorsing Mrs. Clinton, his former Democratic presidential rival and secretary of state, Mr. <name>Obama</name> said he did not think a candidate had ever been so qualified for the office. “I know how hard this job can be,” he said. “That’s why I know <name>Hillary</name> will be so good at it.” The location of the rally is notable. <name>Clinton</name> aides view North Carolina as a potential opportunity to expand on Mr. Obama’s 2012 electoral map. He lost the state four years ago, after winning it in 2008.
