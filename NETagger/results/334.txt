 URL: http:www.nytimes.com20160627magazinewhy-the-supreme-courts-texas-abortion-decision-is-so-momentous.html Monday morning, the United States Supreme Court struck down parts of a Texas law that would have significantly reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state. Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for the magazine; <name>Eric</name> Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School; and <name>William Baude,</name> an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, have been exchanging emails about the meaning and impact of the court’s decision. Hi Eric, Will, The crucial, even monumental, import of the Supreme Court’s 5-3 abortion ruling Monday is its focus on women — their health, well-being and ability to access a constitutional right. Maybe that sounds obvious, but in many of the court’s previous rulings on this subject, it has been anything but. Justice <name>Stephen Breyer’s</name> opinion for the majority delivers an ingredient that’s been missing for 25 years: a definitive statement of what it means for a state to impose an “undue burden” on the right to abortion, by placing a “substantial obstacle” in the path of a woman seeking one. The court established the “undue burden” standard in 1992, but what the test meant appeared to shift over time, until it was close to shapeless. Now the court has issued a clear answer, which gives proper weight to medical expertise and scientific evidence — and respects women and the choices they make. That’s monumental, too. The court was considering new rules, passed in 2013 by the Texas Legislature, requiring abortion clinics to employ a doctor who has privileges to admit patients at a nearby hospital and to meet the construction and equipment standards for an “ambulatory surgical center,” which include temperature controls, hallways wide enough for a gurney and special ventilation units. (The estimated cost of renovating an existing clinic is $1.5 million to $3 million.) If the Texas restrictions were allowed to go fully into effect, the plaintiffs who challenged the law showed, the number of clinics in Texas was projected to drop to eight or nine, from 44 three years ago, across nearly 270,000 square miles. More than 20 states have enacted laws with some or all of the Texas restrictions, so this case had sweeping implications. “We conclude that neither of these provisions offers benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes,” <name>Breyer</name> wrote in an opinion joined by the court’s three other liberals — <name>Ruth Bader</name> Ginsburg, <name>Sonia Sotomayor</name> and <name>Elena Kagan</name> — and the swing voter Justice <name>Anthony Kennedy.</name> So this is what “undue burden” means: a safety precaution that does more harm than good, measured in terms of preventing a woman from having an abortion versus protecting her health. The test for the court, in assessing Texas’ regulations, is whether they make women safer, compared with the previous rules. The answer, the evidence presented in the lower court showed, is no. Before doctors had to get admitting privileges, they had to show they had a working arrangement with a hospital to care for a patient with complications. When asked at argument for a single instance in which admitting privileges “would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case,” Breyer writes. Yet when the state began enforcing the admitting-privilege rule, the number of clinics in the state dropped to about 20 from about 40. (Abortion providers often don’t qualify for the privileges because their rates of complications are too low for regular admissions of patients.) The surgical-center rules are similarly useless. The record showed “that abortions taking place in an abortion facility are safe,” <name>Breyer</name> writes — “indeed safer” than many outpatient procedures for which Texas had no analogous rules. Among the riskier procedures the state didn’t similarly regulate: home births, colonoscopies, liposuction and (from Justice <name>Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s</name> concurring opinion) tonsillectomies and dental surgery. The state singled out abortion for regulation to discourage it. As clinics shut, more women had to travel 100 or 200 miles to reach a clinic. That hit poor women hardest. The balancing test <name>Breyer</name> lays out — burdens to access weighed against benefits to health — makes clear why forcing women to travel long distances can be a violation of the Constitution. This is the first majority opinion in an abortion case by a liberal justice in 16 years. It’s striking to read a Supreme Court majority opinion about abortion that expresses empathy for women going through the procedure. (Breyer wrote then, in the case in <name>Stenberg</name> v. Carhart, to strike down a law against one kind of late-term abortion procedure. That decision was effectively, though not explicitly, overturned seven years later when Justice <name>Kennedy</name> joined the conservatives in <name>Gonzales</name> v. Carhart.) Now <name>Breyer</name> takes the point of view of women in describing how the regulations would force big and sterile abortion clinics to take the place of smaller and homier ones, because of the attendant costs. “In the fact of no threat to women’s health, Texas seeks to force women to travel long distances to get abortions in crammed-to-capacity superfacilities,” he writes. “Patients seeking these services are less likely to get the kind of individualized attention, serious conversation and emotional support that doctors at less taxed facilities may have offered.” He is talking about the psychological components of good medical care. And he’s taking it for granted that women seeking abortions deserve it. In other major cases this term and last, the court’s four liberals have voted as a bloc and refrained from adding separate concurring opinions, in a further show of solidarity. This time, however, Justice <name>Ginsburg</name> wrote for herself, and I’m glad to hear her voice. “It is beyond rational belief” that Texas’ abortion regulations “could genuinely protect the health of women,” she writes. “When a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety.” The French phrase means “for want of a better alternative.” <name>Ginsburg</name> is summoning the dangerous back-alley procedures of the past and the uncertain online abortion-drug market of the present. And she’s also banishing those images, by underscoring the welcome effect of today’s decision: It will help women take care of themselves. <name>Emily </name> Hi Will, Emily, I agree with Emily. You’d need to live in a different universe to believe that the Texas Legislature sought to advance women’s health with this law. It sought to limit abortion by pretending to be concerned about the health of the women who seek abortions. The court was right to invalidate this cynical stunt. Yet I think Justice <name>Clarence Thomas</name> makes a good point in his dissent, where he contrasts this case with <name>Fisher</name> v. University of Texas at Austin. As I pointed out in my first post, the court upheld U.T.’s affirmative-action program last week despite the absence of firm social-scientific evidence that affirmative action advances educational outcomes. Now the court strikes down Texas’ abortion law because of the absence of evidence that the law protects women’s health. If the court wants to make sure that states act only when they have good reason to act, shouldn’t it demand strong evidence in all cases? Why are the speculative benefits of affirmative action for educational outcomes sufficient to uphold an affirmative-action program, while the speculative benefits for women’s health are insufficient for upholding Texas’ law? The explanation is simply this: The court’s liberals care about abortion rig
