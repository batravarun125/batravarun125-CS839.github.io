 URL: http:www.nytimes.com20160628businessmediapodcasts-white-house-axelrod-maron-obama.html <name>David Axelrod</name> was having a candid conversation with an old colleague when, almost accidentally, the two made some news. Mr. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, was talking to <name>Eric H. Holder Jr.,</name> the former attorney general, on his podcast, “The Axe Files.” He had asked Mr. <name>Holder</name> for his thoughts on <name>Edward J.</name> Snowden, the intelligence contractor who leaked classified documents about the National Security Agency in 2013. “We can certainly argue about the way in which <name>Snowden</name> did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in,” Mr. Holder said. It was the first such public admission from the man who was the top law enforcement official in the United States when Mr. <name>Snowden</name> fled the country. The podcast comment was covered widely in the news media. Mr. Holder’s appearance on “The Axe Files” made him another member of a group that might informally be called the Obama-casters. Since the president made a much-noted appearance on the popular podcast “WTF With <name>Marc Maron”</name> in June 2015, three prominent former staffers have started their own shows, sometimes securing lengthy — and occasionally newsworthy — interviews with their administration peers. Mr. Axelrod’s podcast, produced by the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago and CNN, started in September. In May, Mr. Obama’s former speechwriter <name>Jon Favreau</name> and <name>Dan Pfeiffer,</name> a former senior White House adviser, started the weekly “Keepin’ It 1600.” Together, the two shows have hosted close to a dozen former and current members of Mr. Obama’s administration, eliciting in-depth conversations with major figures including <name>Samantha</name> Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations; <name>David</name> Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign; and <name>Ben</name> Rhodes, a national security adviser. While administration officials often embrace media roles after leaving the White House, podcast experts say there is something about the medium that makes particular sense for this administration. “To a certain extent, they’re doing what all White Houses do. They find out what the hot medium of the time is and they exploit it,” said <name>Andy</name> Bowers, the co-founder of Panoply, Slate’s podcast network. “But I feel like podcasting is a medium that is perfectly in sync with the Obama White House and <name>Obama</name> himself.” Mr. <name>Maron</name> agreed, saying that podcasts help to promote intimate personal discussions, something President <name>Obama</name> embraced during their conversation. “He’s very human as presidents go, I think,” Mr. <name>Maron</name> said. Mr. Axelrod, who had not been much of a podcast listener, was taken with the format after hearing Mr. <name>Obama</name> on Mr. Maron’s show. “I thought it was one of the best conversations that I’d heard him have,” Mr. <name>Axelrod</name> said. “It was revealing and interesting, and I thought ‘Boy, this would be fun.’ Mr. Axelrod’s podcast typically consists of a single in-depth interview. He has welcomed reporters and several guests from across the aisle, including <name>Mitt</name> Romney, whom he helped to defeat in the 2012 presidential election. (The two joked about <name>Donald J. Trump.) </name> Mr. <name>Favreau</name> and Mr. Pfeiffer’s podcast is produced by The Ringer, the new website from the sports pundit <name>Bill</name> Simmons. It is faster paced and usually begins with the two hosts bantering about the week in politics — and these days, disparaging Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign — before speaking with a guest. (Mr. <name>Simmons</name> hosted President <name>Obama</name> on his own show in 2012, the first time any sitting president had appeared on a podcast.) Neither Mr. <name>Axelrod<
