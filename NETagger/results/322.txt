It’s there when I go to sleep at night. The constant thrumming of election fraud conspiracists is like the noise made by that board game in the movie “Jumanji.” I didn’t write about this during the primary season, since I didn’t want to dignify the views of conspiracy theorists. But they’re still going. The allegations are remarkably consistent. They go like this: Mr. <name>Sanders</name> did better in the early exit polls than he did in the final result. Therefore, Mrs. <name>Clinton</name> probably stole the election. The exit polls are a sufficient basis to make this determination, in the eyes of the conspiracists, because exit polls are used internationally to detect fraud. They’re supposedly very accurate and “well controlled” (where this phrase comes from, I don’t know). Furthermore, they say, the exit polls were right on the G.O.P. side — confirming the underlying validity of the methodology and raising suspicions about the Democratic vote count. All of this starts with a basic misconception: that the exit polls are usually pretty good. I have no idea where this idea comes from, because everyone who knows anything about early exit polls knows that they’re not great. We can start in 2008, when the exit polls showed a pretty similar bias toward <name>Barack</name> Obama. Or in 2004, when the exit polls showed <name>John Kerry</name> easily winning an election he clearly lost — with both a huge error and systematic bias outside of the “margin of error.” The national exits showed <name>Kerry</name> ahead by three points (and keep in mind the sample size on the national exit is vastly larger than for a state primary exit poll) and leading in states like Virginia, Ohio and Florida — which all went to <name>George W. Bush. </name> The story was similar in 2000. The early exit polls showed <name>Al Gore</name> winning Alabama, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina. Mr. <name>Bush</name> won these states by between six and 15 points. The exit polls showed Mr. <name>Gore</name> winning Florida by six points — leading the networks to call the race before 8 p.m. in the East. The same thing happened in 1996. It was actually even worse in 1992. The exit polls had <name>Bill Clinton</name> winning Texas, which went to <name>George H.W. Bush,</name> and basically everywhere. Now, how can this happen? There are a lot of sources for exit poll error — even more than in an ordinary poll. Here are a few: ■ Differential nonresponse, in which the supporters of one candidate are likelier to participate than those of another candidate. Exit polls have limited means to correct for nonresponse, since they can weight only by visually identifiable characteristics. Hispanic origin, income and education, for instance, are left out. ■ Cluster effects, which happen when the precincts selected aren’t representative of the overall population. This is a very big danger in state exit polls, which include only a small number of precincts. As a result, exit polls have a larger margin of error than an ordinary poll of similar size. These precincts are selected to have the right balance of Democratic and Republican precincts, which isn’t so helpful in a primary. ■ Absentee voters aren’t included at all in states where they represent less than 20 percent or so of the vote. For all these reasons, exit polls can be very inaccurate and systematically biased. With this kind of history, you can see why no one who studies the exit polls believes that they can be used as an indicator of fraud in the way the conspiracy theorists do. But why were exit polls so tilted toward Mr. Sanders? It’s impossible to be 100 percent sure, but the best-known bias in the exit poll offers a very good explanation:
