It was a bright and breezy afternoon, a happy respite from days of stifling heat, and a gang of male models was settling down in front of an outdoor screen at Au Grand Turenne, a bar in the Marais, to watch the Germany-Slovakia match. They had come from all over Europe — the assembled crew represented Germany, Poland, England and France — to walk the runways or haunt the showrooms in Paris. They had spent the week (and some the week before that, in Milan, and before that, in London) hopping from casting audition to fitting, fitting to show, show to showroom. In between, when they could, they caught the games. France is the host country for the 2016 UEFA European Championships, and the games and men’s fashion week collided in Paris. Soccer fans on their way to the Wales-Northern Ireland game on Saturday found themselves sharing a Métro train car with fashion fans heading for the Dior Homme show. The two groups arrived at the same stop in the 16th Arrondissement, eyeing each other with wary amusement — the green-haired and the pochette-clutching — before going their separate directions. (Victor: Wales.) The young men who had gathered at Au Grand Turenne were brothers in arms of Tomorrow Is Another Day, a modeling agency based in Cologne, Germany. Some were veterans; others were in their first season. Timi Babasola-Are, 19, of London, who appeared in shows including <name>Wales Bonner</name> in London and <name>Christian Dada</name> in Paris, had been scouted buying a Tube ticket in the Stratford station. “I was surprised, surprised as hell,” he said. “I don’t think of myself as a model.” He was in Paris for the first time. “It’s nice — a nice little holiday is all,” Mr. <name>Babasola-Are</name> said. “I haven’t got too much work, so with all the walking around, you still get to see things. I saw the Eiffel Tower. And some football.” Even for those not especially interested, the soccer had been hard to ignore. The streets filled regularly with screaming fans, most ear-splittingly when France overcame Ireland earlier that afternoon. Revelry has been unavoidable and has made fans of the usually apathetic. At the very least, it makes for a break from the pressures of the fashion week grind. “Everyone in the hotel’s been watching it,” said <name>Gaby</name> Sahhar, 23, a Londoner with a shaved head and an alien look that earned him appearances at shows including Hood by Air and Palm Angels in Paris. “To be fair, I feel like this week has made me a big fan, just because it’s been on. I’ve become hooked on it. In a weird way, I know what’s going on — with the cheering in the street, you kind of have to know what’s going on. You become part of it.” <name>Morgan</name> Doughty, 20, of Cornwall, England, who’d just come from the <name>Paul Smith</name> show, added, “You learn what’s going on by who’s happy.” Within minutes, the Germans at the table were happy when the defender <name>Jérôme Boateng</name> scored the first goal. <name>Benno</name> Bulang, 18, from Dresden, who appeared on the runway for Prada in Milan, and Balenciaga, <name>Valentino</name> and <name>Louis Vuitton</name> in Paris, looked especially pleased. Mr. Boateng, who is black, has been a major force on the German team; it was a teachable victory for a touchy moment in European history. “He was criticized in Germany by some racists; because of the refugee crisis, we have a massive growth of radical parties,” Mr. <name>Bulang</name> told a fellow model, Amin Djoneidi, 18, from outside Paris. “One of these members was saying it’s not O.K. that a black guy plays for the German team.” He recalled an earlier game saved by Mr. Boateng. “If he wouldn’t have been there, they would have lost,” he said. “It’s changing the
