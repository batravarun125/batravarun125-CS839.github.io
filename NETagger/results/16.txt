But investors in several venture funds are bucking that notion. On Wednesday, the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had raised a total of $1.4 billion across two investment funds over the last couple of months. <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> joins a list of venture firms that have recently raised more than a billion dollars. In the first quarter of this year, Founders Fund raised $1.3 billion, while Accel and Norwest Venture Partners each raised $1.2 billion, according to National Venture Capital Association data. Over all, the American venture industry raised $12 billion in the first quarter, a 59 percent increase by dollar commitments from the previous year, but a 17 percent decrease in total number of funds, the data shows. A spokeswoman for <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> said the firm was in a quiet period and could not discuss the filings. <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> has raised $1 billion for its KPCB Digital Growth Fund III, according to the filings. Growth funds tend to be large because they are used to fund older, late-stage private companies that need more money to grow. Late-stage investments have grabbed headlines over the last few years for producing more than 160 private companies valued at more than $1 billion, including Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox and Snapchat. <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> raised its first late-stage investment fund in 2010, and this is the firm’s third such vehicle. Partners Mary Meeker, Ted Schlein, Mood Rowghani and <name>Noah Knauf</name> will lead the growth fund. This year, Mr. <name>Knauf</name> joined <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> from Warburg Pincus, where he was known for his investments in health care-related companies. <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> also raised $400 million for its seventh venture fund, which makes smaller, earlier-stage investments. That fund will be led by partners <name>Ted Schlein, Beth Seidenberg, Mike Abbott, Wen Hsieh</name> and <name>Eric Feng.</name> Mr. <name>Feng</name> recently joined the firm from Flipboard. He also worked at <name>Kleiner Perkins</name> six years before in an investing role. <name>John</name> Doerr, the firm’s longtime leader, said in March that he was stepping back from day-to-day management.
