 URL: http:www.nytimes.com20160630uspoliticsbill-clinton-mark-cuban.html On a fund-raising swing to the West Coast last weekend, <name>Bill Clinton</name> had a casual dinner with <name>Mark</name> Cuban, the outspoken businessman and TV star who has inserted himself into the 2016 campaign, criticizing <name>Donald J. Trump</name> and even offering himself as a potential vice-presidential candidate for <name>Hillary Clinton. </name> The dinner took place at the Los Angeles home of <name>Michael</name> Kives, a Hollywood agent and a top bundler for Mrs. Clinton, and comes amid one of the more unusual political courtships unfolding in the 2016 campaign. Mr. Cuban, the often-fined owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team for his outlandish comments and berating of N.B.A. officials, and a star of ABC’s “Shark Tank,” had previously said he planned to sit down with Mrs. Clinton. In the meantime, he enjoyed an extended conversation about politics, business and philanthropy with the former president, said three people with firsthand knowledge of the gathering who could not discuss a private event for attribution. An aide said Mr. <name>Clinton</name> regularly tacks on social events with friends while traveling the country to help his wife’s campaign. The small but eclectic dinner party in Los Angeles also included the musician <name>Stevie</name> Wonder: the actors <name>Bryan Cranston</name> and <name>Ted Danson; John Dauer,</name> the vocalist in the band The Ruse and a friend of <name>Chelsea</name> Clinton; and <name>Gene</name> Sperling, an economic adviser to both Mr. <name>Clinton</name> and President Obama. Mr. <name>Clinton</name> has known Mr. Cuban for several years. The billionaire has attended <name>Clinton</name> Global Initiative conferences, watched basketball with the 42nd president, and spoke at a Clinton Foundation-related event in Dallas last year that also featured former President <name>George W. Bush. </name> While the dinner was not a fund-raiser, it did further immerse Mr. Cuban, whose incendiary statements and pro-business positions could turn off some Democrats, in the inner circle of Mrs. Clinton’s West Coast supporters, should he decide to give to the <name>Clinton</name> campaign or “super PAC” supporting such efforts. Mr. <name>Cuban</name> did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. A spokesman for Mr. <name>Clinton</name> declined to comment. Last month, Mr. <name>Cuban</name> told NBC’s “Meet the Press” he would “absolutely” entertain the idea of being Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, but that “she would have to go more to the center.” Asked about Mr. Cuban’s comments, Mrs. <name>Clinton</name> said, “I appreciate his openness to it,” adding: “I think we should look widely and broadly. It’s not just people in elective office. It is successful business people.” While a Clinton-Cuban ticket is extremely unlikely, and there is no sign the businessman is being vetted in Mrs. Clinton’s running-mate search, the banter has put Mr. Cuban in the position of being an outspoken TV personality and billionaire who could potentially be a useful weapon against a Republican nominee with a similar résumé. Mr. Cuban has grown increasingly critical of Mr. Trump. The #NeverTrump movement had tried to get Mr. Cuban to consider a third-party run, but last month he told MSNBC, “There’s not enough time and it just wouldn’t work.” He did credit Mr. <name>Trump</name> for opening up a pathway for nontraditional candidates. “You don’t have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would’ve been in the past,” Mr. Cuban said. As Mrs. <name>Clinton</name> seeks to appeal to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and voters who supported Senator <name>Bernie</name> Sanders, her campaign is simultaneously, and delicately, seeking the endorsements of Republican and Republican-leaning business leaders. Mr. <name>Cuban</name> has said he would like to vote Republican on fiscal issues and a smaller government, but disagrees with the party on most social issues. Last week, just before Mrs. <name>Clinton</name> delivered a populist economic pitch alongside Senator <name>Elizabeth</name> Warren, her campaign released a list of business leaders, including several Republicans, who had endorsed her, including <name>Daniel F. Akerson,</name> the former chairman and chief executive of General Motors, and <name>Richard</name> Anderson, the Delta Air Lines executive. On Friday, <name>Henry M. Paulson</name> Jr., the treasury secretary under Mr. <name>Bush</name> during the 2008 financial crisis and a former Goldman Sachs chief executive, expressed his support for Mrs. Clinton. In The Washington Post, Mr. <name>Paulson</name> wrote that a Trump presidency would be “unthinkable.”
