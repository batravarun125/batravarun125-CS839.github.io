All the key members of the creative team are <name>Tony</name> winners: the songwriters; the book writer, <name>Terrence McNally;</name> and the director <name>Darko</name> Tresnjak, who returns to Broadway after his success with the 2014 best musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder.” According to the producers’ announcement, the new show is “inspired” by the 1997 animated film and features several songs from its score and many new ones; and the 1956 live-action film that starred <name>Ingrid Bergman</name> and Yul Brynner. Up-and-coming actors will take the two principal roles on Broadway: <name>Christy Altomare</name> (“Mamma Mia!”) will be Anya, the young girl unsure of her identity, and <name>Derek Klena</name> (“Dogfight”) is Dmitry. <name>John Bolton</name> and <name>Caroline</name> O’Connor, who co-starred in “A Christmas Story: The Musical,” are in the cast as well.
