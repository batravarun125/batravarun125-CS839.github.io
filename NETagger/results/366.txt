Goals from <name>Jerome</name> Boateng, <name>Mario Gomez</name> and <name>Julian Draxler</name> ensured that the 2014 World Cup champions would not rue <name>Mesut Ozil’s</name> missed penalty kick early in the game. Germany produced its best performance of the tournament, showing its defensive resilience as well as attacking ambition in a display that augurs well for the tougher challenges ahead. Up next is a quarterfinal clash against either the two-time defending champion Spain or Italy. <name>Boateng</name> scored in the eighth minute when his shot from outside the penalty area took a slight deflection into the left corner of the net. It was the fastest goal scored by Germany at a European Championships, and the first for <name>Boateng</name> in 63 international appearances. <name>Ozil</name> had the chance to double the lead six minutes later from the penalty spot after <name>Martin Skrtel</name> shoved Gomez, but goalkeeper <name>Matus Kozacik</name> guessed the right way and palmed away Ozil’s effort. It was the first missed penalty by a German player at the European Championships since <name>Uli Hoeness</name> shot over the bar as Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany, 5-3, in a penalty shootout in the 1976 final. <name>Antonin Panenka</name> scored the winning penalty with a chip down the middle. Germany is the only team remaining at Euro 2016 that has yet to concede a goal.
