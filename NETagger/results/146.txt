The woman, <name>Jocelyn</name> G. Winfrey, 53, was attacked by the dogs in a fenced-in area after walking onto the property of an acquaintance, <name>Hamilton</name> H. Hicks, on <name>Ella T. Grasso Boulevard</name> on June 20, according to a news release issued on Tuesday by the New Haven Police Department. Ms. <name>Winfrey</name> lost an arm, a leg and her eyesight as a result of the attack, according to local reports, which described the dogs as bulldog mixes. A neighbor told The Hartford Courant that Mr. Hicks, who the police said was bitten by the dogs several times, had tried to help Ms. <name>Winfrey</name> by lying on top of her. “He was trying to protect her,” the neighbor, <name>Brian Wingate,</name> told The Courant. Mr. Hicks, 36, faces a drug charge after the police said they found three bags of crack cocaine in his possession. No one was charged in connection with the mauling. “The dogs that attacked were lawfully owned and on private property,” the police release said. Ms. <name>Winfrey</name> is survived by a son, according to a GoFundMe page created to raise money for her funeral. “At this time the family is in mourning and trying to cope with the tragedy and loss of my sister Jocelyn,” Ms. Winfrey’s brother, <name>Charles Minchenko,</name> said in a statement. “We appreciate the outpouring of love and support.”
