Honestly, less fuss has been made over some men when they won titles on Centre Court. But all this ado on Wednesday was reserved for the British qualifier <name>Marcus Willis</name> as he finally won a game in the second round against <name>Roger Federer. </name> Disproportionate? It did not seem so as you sat there taking it all in under a closed roof that had not succeeded in blocking out any of the sunshine in Willis’s back story. And if the crowd was not in Federer’s corner for a change, it was because <name>Willis</name> was playing not just for them, but as one of them. With a world ranking of 772, Willis, 25, was the closest thing this Wimbledon had to an Everyman, and he had come very close to quitting professional tennis this year. He has been supplementing his modest income by playing club team tennis in France and by giving tennis lessons to youngsters for 30 pounds an hour at an English yacht club. But he has found both love and a fine patch of tennis form in the past few months, and he managed to reach the main draw at Wimbledon for the first time after getting through the imposing gantlet of prequalifying and qualifying. On paper, this was one of the biggest mismatches at this stage of a Grand Slam tournament, and though Federer’s winning score of 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 would indicate that it was a mismatch on grass as well, it was full of engaging rallies, entertainment value and human interest. “Not my standard Wednesday, that,” <name>Willis</name> said with a poorly suppressed grin. “Next Wednesday might be quite different. I have to check my diary and see who I’ve got on Wednesday, but it’s not playing <name>Roger Federer</name> on Centre Court.” What made this Wednesday special was the way both of the participants approached it: <name>Willis</name> communicating his wide-eyed enthusiasm to the crowd; <name>Federer</name> striking just the right empathetic tone before, during and after the match. “This story is gold,” <name>Federer</name> said after advancing to the third round. “I just hope the press respects his situation. It’s easy now to just use it, chew it up and then throw it all away. He’s got a life after this. He’s got a career after this. He definitely made the most of it. He enjoyed it. Must have been so much going on. It’s not been simple for him, as well, to handle it. But I thought he handled it great on the court. I wish him the best.” There was quite a buildup to the match on BBC. There were feature pieces and interviews with Willis’s family, his girlfriend and his nascent fan club (the Will Bombs), which already has a Twitter account and which guaranteed big trouble for Federer, the seven-time Wimbledon champion who is seeded third this year. <name>Federer</name> was one of those enjoying the coverage. “I watched it all, because it interested me, too,” he said. “I was fascinated by his run.” <name>Federer</name> had already reached out to <name>Willis</name> before the match, congratulating him in the player restaurant after Willis’s first-round victory over Ricardas Berankis. That was Willis’s first tour-level match, and it made him the lowest-ranked British man to win a singles match at Wimbledon. On Wednesday, <name>Federer</name> said, when it came time to walk out of the tunnel onto Centre Court, he gave <name>Willis</name> the choice of going first or second. <name>Willis</name> went out first and raised his right arm in triumph as he arrived in the closest thing tennis has to a temple. He then shook his head in something resembling disbelief all the way to his chair amid the loud applause. The photos that soon appeared on the electronic scoreboard next to each player’s biography seemed like a fine reflection of the situation: <name>Federer</name> smiling subtly in his mug shot; <name>Willis</name> appearing on the verge of major laughter in his.
