Defender <name>Toby Alderweireld</name> opened the scoring with a header in the 10th minute after poor marking by the Hungary defense. But Belgium had to wait until the closing stages of the game to secure a convincing victory behind Hazard at the Stadium de Toulouse. Hazard surged past a group of Hungary defenders on the left side before supplying a perfect low cross for <name>Michy Batshuayi</name> to steer home in the 78th minute, just two minutes after <name>Batshuayi</name> had entered the game. Hazard followed up almost immediately with a spectacular goal, breaking down the left on another counterattack before cutting inside, skipping past three Hungary defenders and curling a shot into the bottom-right corner. <name>Yannick Ferreira Carrasco</name> scored the fourth goal in stoppage time as Belgium set up a meeting with Wales. Belgium stretched Hungaryâ€™s defense on numerous occasions with its creative attacking play, with Hazard and <name>Kevin De Bruyne</name> pulling the strings. <name>De Bruyne</name> hit the crossbar with a free kick in the 35th minute and was denied several times by goalkeeper <name>Gabor Kiraly. </name> Belgium goalkeeper <name>Thibaut Courtois</name> nearly gifted Hungary a goal when he slipped while trying to control a back pass in the first half. Luckily for Courtois, the ball trickled out for a corner kick.
